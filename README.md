# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the process of developing solutions using software thst is reliable and effecient

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early computing-use of machine code and early assembly code.Early programming languages like FORTRAN,COBOL
Structuring programming-Use of top-down design principles.Emphasise on writing codes that's more understandable and maintainable.
Formal methods and methodologies-Use of formal methods and mathematical approaches to software development.waterfall
Object oriented programming(oop)-Introduction of oop with language C++ promoted usde of objects and models in  real world .improve reusability and organization


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirments-documenting,gathering
Design-framework
Implementation-coding
Testing-run the code
Deployment-circulate to clients
Maintenance-Updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies-follows linear approach to software development that emphasises a structured ,sequential process.
Agile methodologies-Principle and practises for software development that prioritize flexibility ,collaboration and customer feedback
appropriate(waterfall)-predictable,simple and small projects,requirements are well defined ,stable
(agile)-customer involvement,complex projects,Innovation driven projects

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-deisgn and development,documenation of codes,collaboration with other developers,Requirements analysis ie collaborate with project managers to determine the requirementof the projects
quality Assurance engineer-test planning and execution,bug identification and reporting,collaboration,ensure projects meet the highest standard of compliance
Project manager-lead team,manage funds,ensure the stakeholders satisfaction,evaluate project performance,solve issues


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each
IDE-enhances productivity,improves code quality,code management,project management
VCS-tracks changes,collaboration,backup and recovery,accountability

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
strict budgeting.collaborate with project managers and business analysts to come up with the most accurate budget.
technical risks.run manual and automated tests to spot issues.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-test planning and stratergy,test execution
system testing-bug identification and reporting
acceptance testing-projects that meet quality metrics,compliance and standards


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The process of teachin an AI to give the most accurate information 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
tell me something in german
translate this word from english to german
